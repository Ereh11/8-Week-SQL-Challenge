Here is the 8 sample customers provided in the sample subscriptions table.

**Table: Sample of `subscriptions` table**

<img width="261" src="https://github.com/Ereh11/8-Week-SQL-Challenge/blob/main/Resources/case3.3.png">

- I write a brief description about each customer‚Äôs journey.

**Description:**

```sql
SELECT s.customer_id,
	   s.plan_id, 
       start_date
FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions s
INNER JOIN foodie_fi.plans p
USING(plan_id)
WHERE s.customer_id IN (1,2,11,13,15,16,18,19)
ORDER BY s.customer_id;
```

| customer_id | plan_id | start_date               |
| ----------- | ------- | ------------------------ |
| 1           | 1       | 2020-08-08T00:00:00.000Z |

## B. Data Analysis Questions

### 1. How many customers has Foodie-Fi ever had?

To determine the count of unique customers for Foodie-Fi, I utilize the `COUNT()` function wrapped around `DISTINCT`.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS Number_Of_Customers
FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions;
```

**Answer:**

| Number_Of_Customers |
| ----------------- |
| 1000              |

- Foodie-Fi has 1,000 unique customers.

### 2. What is the monthly distribution of trial plan start_date values for our dataset - use the start of the month as the group by value

```sql
SELECT DATE_PART('MONTH', start_date) AS Month,
	   COUNT(customer_id) AS Monthly_Distribution
FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions
INNER JOIN foodie_fi.plans
USING(plan_id)
WHERE plan_name = 'trial'
GROUP BY DATE_PART('MONTH', start_date)
ORDER BY Month;
```

**Answer:**

| month | monthly_distribution |
| ----- | -------------------- |
| 1     | 88                   |
| 2     | 68                   |
| 3     | 94                   |
| 4     | 81                   |
| 5     | 88                   |
| 6     | 79                   |
| 7     | 89                   |
| 8     | 88                   |
| 9     | 87                   |
| 10    | 79                   |
| 11    | 75                   |
| 12    | 84                   |

- March has the highest number of trial plans, and February has the lowest number.

### 3. What plan start_date values occur after the year 2020 for our dataset? Show the breakdown by count of events for each plan_name.

````sql
SELECT p.plan_id,
	   p.plan_name,
	   COUNT(s.customer_id) AS Number_Of_Events
       
FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions AS s
INNER JOIN foodie_fi.plans AS p
USING(plan_id)
WHERE s.start_date >= '2021-01-01'
GROUP BY p.plan_id, p.plan_name
ORDER BY plan_id, number_of_events DESC;
````

**Answer:**

| plan_id | plan_name     | number_of_events |
| ------- | ------------- | ---------------- |
| 1       | basic monthly | 8                |
| 2       | pro monthly   | 60               |
| 3       | pro annual    | 63               |
| 4       | churn         | 71               |

### 4. What is the customer count and percentage of customers who have churned rounded to 1 decimal place?

```sql
SELECT Churned_Customers,
	   ROUND(Churned_Customers / Total * 100, 1) AS Churned_Percentage
FROM 
(
	SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN s.plan_id = 4 THEN 1.0 ELSE 0.0 END) AS Churned_Customers,
  		   COUNT(DISTINCT s.customer_id) * 1.0 AS Total
	FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions AS s
) AS TP;
```

**Answer:**

| churned_customers | churned_percentage |
| ----------------- | ------------------ |
| 307.0             | 30.7               |

- 307 customers have churned. This represents approximately 30.7% of the overall customers.

### 5. How many customers have churned straight after their initial free trial - what percentage is this rounded to the nearest whole number?

```sql
WITH CTE AS 
(

  SELECT s.customer_id,
  		 plan_name,
  		 LEAD(plan_name) OVER(PARTITION BY s.customer_id ORDER BY start_date) AS Ld
  FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions AS s
  INNER JOIN foodie_fi.plans AS p
  USING(plan_id)
)

SELECT ChurnAfterTrial,
	   ROUND(ChurnAfterTrial / (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) * 1.0 FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions) * 100) AS ChurnAfterTrialPercentage
FROM
(
	SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN plan_name = 'trial' AND Ld = 'churn' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS ChurnAfterTrial
 	FROM CTE
) AS TP;
	   
```

**Answer:**

| churnaftertrial | churnaftertrialpercentage |
| --------------- | ------------------------- |
| 92              | 9                         |


- 92 customers churned after the initial free trial period, representing approximately 9% of the overall customers.
